## ðŸ§¬ Hello!

My Name is Lambert and I'm an Frontend Webdeveloper from Germany.

I started Web Development when I was about 13 years old.

It was like an On/Off Relationship because the learning curve was pretty high at first.

When I turned 16 I found my passion in coding and learning new Stuff.

I picked up my old projects and wanted to improve them and make better things out of them.

On this GitHub I showcase projects I'm currently working on and the pinned repos are my finished projects.

### ðŸ”­ Skillset

- `HTML` - 7 years of experience
- `CSS` - 7 years of experience
- `JavaScript` - 2 years of experience
- `NodeJS` - 2 years of experience

Currently I'm improving my `JavaScript` and `React` knowledge!
